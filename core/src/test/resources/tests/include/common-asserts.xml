  The following is a set of common assertions that can be included in
  other tests.

  Assertions are organized in groups known as assert groups. You can
  include a group of assertions in the test by using the include
  processing instruction.

  <?include ../../common-asserts.xml#{group-name} ?>

  Where  #{group-name} is the name of the group to include. If you
  leave out the hashtag then all groups in the file will be included.
