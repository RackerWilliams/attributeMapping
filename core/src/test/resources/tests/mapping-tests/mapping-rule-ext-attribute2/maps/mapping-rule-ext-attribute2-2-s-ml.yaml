             This is an example of a multiValue extended attribute.
             Here the faws/policy may contain multiple values.
  rules:
  - remote:
    - path: "'PT2H'"
    - path: "'AWSPolicy'"
    local:
      user:
        domain: "{D}"
        foo:
          value: "{0}"
          type: xs:dateTime
        name: "{D}"
        email: "{D}"
        roles: "{D}"
        expire: "{D}"
      faws:
        policy:
          value:
          - "{1}"
          multiValue: true
  - local:
      user: {}
      faws:
        policy:
          #
          # Shows off an array where one value is a literal and the
          # other is derived from an XPath.
          #
          value:
          - AWSPolicy2
          - |-
            {Pts(
                 (: Okay this is silly but let's just return
                    a simple string :)
                 'AWSPolicy YEA!' )}
          multiValue: true
  - local:
      user: {}
      faws:
        policy:
        #
        # XPath as a first item, we use Pt instead of Pts because we are
        # really just returning 1 item
        #
        - |-
          {Pt(
               'AWSPolicy3'
          )}
        - AWSPolicy YEA!!
