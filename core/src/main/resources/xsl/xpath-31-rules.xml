     This file contains rules about what functions should be allowed
     in XPaths used in mapping policies.

     It also contains a list of namespaces that are made available in
     mapping XPaths without having to be defined.

     To keep this file short namespaces are denoted by their
     namespace prefixes. The prefixes are defined using standard
     xmlns attributes.

     For now, this configuration is not dynamic, it is examined when
     attribute mapping library itself is compiled.

        These are the common namespace prefixes that will be predefind
        in XPaths.  This means that they do not need to be declared in
        mapping policies.
    -->
    <common ns="mapping saml2 saml2p xs xsi fn math map array"/>

    <!--
        Only functions in these namespaces will be allowed. Any
        function in a different namespace will be rejected.
    -->
    <allowed ns="xs fn math map array mapping"/>

    <!--
        The following functions will be blocked. If the function
        is encountered anywhere in an XPath the mapping policy
        will not validate.

        Please note that functions must be specified with an
        appropriate namespace prefix.
